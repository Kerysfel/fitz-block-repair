# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution. This project is small and focused, so we value clear problem statements and minimal, well-scoped changes.

## Ways To Help

- Report bugs with a minimal PDF and a short reproduction note.
- Propose improvements to clustering heuristics with before/after screenshots.
- Add or refine demo cases in `examples/data`.

## Development Setup

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Demo Run

```bash
uv run examples/demo.py
```

## Pull Requests

- Keep changes focused and explain the reasoning in the PR description.
- Prefer readable code over clever shortcuts.
- If you change clustering behavior, update the demo artifacts and the report.
